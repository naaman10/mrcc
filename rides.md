  headline: Introductory Rides
  content: "Intro rides are perfect for those who are just starting out in road cycling
    and what to learn more and get involved in group rides. \n\nOur intro rides include:\n\n1.
    \ A quick demonstration about how to ride in a group and helpful safety tips \n2.
    Followed by a short easy paced ride, usually around 25 miles at a steady 15-16mph.\n3.
    Rides will be accompanied by two ride leaders. One will stay in front to set the
    pace and lead the way, the other will stay at the back of the group to make sure
    that nobody gets separated or left behind. \n4. Rides will finish with a cafe
    stop for some coffee and cake where you can ask your ride leaders any question
    you have about cycling."
