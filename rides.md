  headline: Introductory Rides
  content: 'Intro rides are perfect for those who are just starting out in road cycling
    and what to learn more and get involved in group rides. Our intro rides include:
    <br>&lt;ol&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;A quick demonstration about how to ride in a group
    and helpful safety tips&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Followed by a short easy paced
    ride, usually around 25 miles at a steady 15-16mph.&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Rides
    will be accompanied by two ride leaders. One will stay in front to set the pace
    and lead the way, the other will stay at the back of the group to make sure that
    nobody gets separated or left behind.&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;Rides will finish
    with a cafe stop for some coffee and cake where you can ask your ride leaders
    any question you have about cycling.&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ol&gt;'
